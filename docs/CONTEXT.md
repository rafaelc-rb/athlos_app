# Athlos — Project Context

## Name Origin

The name **Athlos** comes from *Dodekathlos* (Δωδέκαθλος) — the Twelve Labors of Heracles in Greek mythology. The word *athlos* (ἆθλος) means "labor", "trial", or "heroic feat". The app's visual identity and theme follow this Greek mythological line.

## Overview

Athlos is a workout and diet tracking app composed of two main modules: **Training** and **Diet**. The initial focus is on the Training module.

On first interaction, the user chooses which module to use — training, diet, or both. The interface adapts accordingly, showing or hiding features to keep the experience clean and focused.

## Modules

| Module   | Status        | Description                                    |
| -------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Training | 🔨 Priority   | Workout registration, planning, and tracking   |
| Diet     | 📋 Planned    | Food registration, meals, and caloric control  |

See each module's documentation for details:

- [Diet Module](./modules/DIET.md)

## Future Ideas

- **AI assistant (Quíron)** — inspired by **Chiron** (Χείρων), the wise centaur from Greek mythology who mentored heroes like Achilles and Heracles. The idea is to use Chiron as the AI persona, reinforcing the mythological theme. Features include personalized workout/diet suggestions and a Q&A chat.
- **Health app integrations** — Apple Health, Google Fit, etc. for importing activity data and body metrics.
- **Kleos (κλέος)** — gamification system named after the Greek concept of eternal glory and renown that heroes pursued. Achievements, streaks, challenges, and progression rewards to keep users motivated on their journey.
