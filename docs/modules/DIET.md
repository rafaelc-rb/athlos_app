> Status: 📋 Planned — future development.

## Features

### Food Registration

Nutritional food records. The data model must be **scalable**, allowing registration of basic macronutrients up to more specific data (vitamins, minerals, amino acids, etc.) as needs grow.

- Macronutrients (protein, carbs, fat)
- Micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, etc.)
- Extensible fields for additional nutritional data

### Meal Builder

- Create meals by combining registered foods
- View nutritional totals per meal
- **AI assist (future):** meal suggestions based on user goals and preferences

### Caloric Control

- Estimated daily kcal and macros consumed
- Log caloric expenditure (physical activities, basal metabolic rate)
- Daily caloric balance (intake vs. expenditure)
- **AI tracking (future):** trend analysis and recommendations based on history

### Integrations (future)

- **Training Module:** automatically pull caloric expenditure data from logged workout executions
- **Health apps:** Apple Health, Google Fit, etc. for importing activity data and body metrics
