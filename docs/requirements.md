# Requirements

Requirements organized by release phase using [MoSCoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) prioritization.

- **Must** — essential for the phase to ship
- **Should** — important but not blocking release
- **Could** — desirable if time allows
- **Won't (this phase)** — explicitly deferred to a later phase

See [Versioning Strategy](./context.md#versioning-strategy) for how version numbers map to releases.
